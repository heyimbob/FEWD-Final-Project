            <p>When I discovered Crossfit in 2006 I found my passion. Since then, I spent nearly every moment of my spare time seeking perfection in movement. As I continued to develop as an athlete, I found that helping others gave me just as much excitement as performing the workouts.
                Now, there are two things that bring me more joy than just about anything else. Seeing a person achieve what they never thought was possible, and seeing those people unite in an effort to make themselves better. My desire is to provide the best possible experience to each and every individual who walks through Turbine’s doors.</p>

              <p>I found CrossFit in the summer of 2012 while looking for a different avenue to get stronger for my upcoming junior year of softball at Lewis University. I ended up doing “Karen” as my first workout and fell in love. After the soreness wore off a few days later I headed back into the box and never looked back. CrossFit has not only strengthened my body but it’s also strengthened my spirit and my self-esteem. I love that CrossFit is a community and everyone is pushing each other to get better every single day.
                  I have been coaching CrossFit in 2014 and I’m so excited to be a part of the amazing CrossFit Turbine team. I have to say that my favorite part of coaching is seeing people smile after they complete a workout or a movement they never thought they could do. That’s the best.</p>

                <p>Sports and athletics have always been a prominent part of my life. As a former gymnast and collegiate volleyball player, I was looking for ways to continue to compete in sports. My husband introduced me to CrossFit in 2012 and I have been completely addicted ever since. CrossFitting for almost two years now, I love the camaraderie and competitive spirit CrossFit creates. My  gymnastics and volleyball skills came back in to play, and I love the team atmosphere and competing with others. When I am not at the box, I work as a full-time physical therapist and keep busy with my family and pooch. I am so excited to start interning at CrossFit Turbine and can’t wait to begin sharing my passion for CrossFit and helping people improve their skills and achieve their goals. I also am excited to have the opportunity to work with such an amazing group of coaches and help build a strong CF community.</p>

                  <p>I am a West Chicago native that grew up as a multi-sport athlete in my younger years. Soccer became my focus and one of my passions throughout high school. I am a 2-time captain of both the Wheaton Academy soccer team and the Wheaton College Thunder Men’s team. I found CrossFit in the spring of 2010 and as a college goalkeeper I found it extremely beneficial as a strength and conditioning program and used the CrossFit methodology as a basis for my offseason training. Not long after I earned my level 1 trainer certification and began to get more involved with coaching the new and upcoming sport. CrossFit has developed into a true passion for me. I come from a huge sports family and we enjoy skiing, snowboarding, paddle boarding, biking, you name it and we probably do it. The community of CrossFit is something that is unmatched, you meet countless like minded people and develop some life-long friends.</p>
